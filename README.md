# About this App
This is a wrapper (proxy server) for Geoplugin API (http://geoplugin.net) which solves the 'CORS issue' in my deployed frontend application built with React and Redux.

'request-ip' library helps us to get the user's IP and attach it to the API call.

# Libraries used
1. Express
2. Cors
3. Request
4. Request-ip
